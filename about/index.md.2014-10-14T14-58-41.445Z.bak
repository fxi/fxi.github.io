During my bachelor's degree in geography and master's degree in environmental sciences, I've developed a great interest in a wide range of subjects related to spatial and temporal data, especially spatial/urban planning, biodiversity, climate changes and statistic in social science. I'm also an enthusiast of open source projects, such as R, Grass-GIS, Linux, git, LaTeX, arduino and Leaflet, just to name a few. I'm trying integrate those tools in my personal and professional everyday work.

After a master thesis on alpine aquatic insects distribution modelling, I completed two terms for the laboratory of ecology and aquatic biology at Geneva University to develop some R applications and scripts in this field. 

This site describes briefly some projects i've done so far.

In a near future, this site will also provide an access to all papers i've written. Maybe someone could find some interesting ideas, references or data visualisation.

Please send me your comments and critics at <f@fxi.io>.
